## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Phase 1 (This Week) - Highest Impact + Easiest
1. `/luckiest` & `/unluckiest` - Direct API calls
2. `/records` - Simple aggregation
3. `/rivalry` - Uses existing matchup data

### Phase 2 (Next Sprint) - The Wow Factor
4. `/prophecy` - Integrate with GPT
5. `/cursed` & `/miracle` - Pattern matching
6. `/nemesis` - H2H analysis

### Phase 3 (Future) - The Complex Ones
7. `/powerrankings` - Need algorithm design
8. `/vibes` - Momentum calculations
9. `/trash` - AI integration

## NOTES:
- All scores consider we have ESPN data (2010-2024) and performance data (2015-2024)
- Commands using existing APIs score higher on effort
- "Wow factor" heavily weights uniqueness and entertainment value
- Some low-validity ideas (like `/zodiac`) score well on fun factor alone
