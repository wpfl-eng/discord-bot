## 📊 Overview

Based on analysis of the WPFL historical data, here are the key insights discovered:

## 🏆 All-Time Points Leaders

| Rank | Owner | Total Points | Avg/Season |
|------|-------|-------------|------------|
${insights.ownerStats.totalPointsRanking
  .map(o => `| ${o.rank} | ${o.owner} | ${o.totalPoints.toLocaleString()} | ${o.avgPerSeason} |`)
  .join('\n')}

### Key Findings:
- **Mike S** leads all-time with 24,712.34 total points
- Top 4 owners (Mike S, Adler, Nixon, AJ) are separated by less than 1,100 points
- Significant drop-off after the top 11 (Doug at 20,936)
- Rick and Mims have significantly fewer points, suggesting fewer seasons played

## 📈 Suggested Visualizations

### 1. Interactive Line Chart - "The Journey"
- **What**: Total points accumulation over time for each owner

- **Tool**: Chart.js with hover tooltips showing season details

### 2. Head-to-Head Heat Map - "The Rivalry Matrix"
- **What**: Grid showing all-time records between each pair of owners
- **Why**: Reveals dominant matchups and competitive rivalries
- **Tool**: D3.js heat map with color intensity showing win percentage

### 3. Championship Timeline - "Dynasty Tracker"
- **What**: Timeline showing championship wins and playoff appearances
- **Why**: Identifies dynasties and drought periods

- **Why**: Shows how the game has evolved (rule changes, strategy shifts)
- **Tool**: Combination line/area chart

### 5. Luck vs Skill Scatter - "The Fortune Chart"
- **What**: Expected wins vs actual wins plotted for each owner
- **Why**: Identifies consistently lucky/unlucky owners
- **Tool**: Plotly scatter plot with regression line
